        Pushes an element onto the stack represented by this deque (in other words, at the head of this deque)
         if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, throwing an IllegalStateException
         if no space is currently available.
This method is equivalent to addFirst.
Throws:
IllegalStateException – if the element cannot be added at this time due to capacity restrictions
ClassCastException – if the class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this deque
NullPointerException – if the specified element is null and this deque does not permit null elements
IllegalArgumentException – if some property of the specified element prevents it from being added to this deque
